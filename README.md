# voronoi

A Simple program to create [Voronoi diagrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram).

![Voronoi Diagram](examples/voronoi.png?raw=true "Voronoi Diagram")

### Usage

```
make
./voronoi
```

And then a PPM file will be created called `voronoi.ppm`. This is your Voronoi diagram.
It is preferable to use an external tool to convert the `.ppm` file to another format that
is more space-efficient, such as `.png`.

### Examples

A few samples of output are available in the `examples` subdirectory.
